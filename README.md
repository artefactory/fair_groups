# üìÑ Fairness-aware Grouping for Continuous Sensitive Variables

This repository contains the code and experiments accompanying our paper:

**"Fairness-Aware Grouping for Continuous Sensitive Variables: Application for Debiasing Face Analysis with respect to Skin Tone"**  
*Submitted to ECAI 2025*

---

## üîç Overview

The main goal is to analyze fairness in computer vision models with respect to skin tone variations using a novel data-driven approach and then extend it to bias mitigation. 

See notebooks folder for full examples of the usage.

## üéØ Usage

### Using pip

```bash
pip install fair-partition
```

### From source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fair-partition.git
cd fair-partition
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
make install-dev
```

3. Build and install the package:
```bash
make build-and-install
```

### Example

Here's a quick example showing how to use the package to create fair groups and visualize the results with confidence intervals:

```python
import numpy as np
from fair_partition.partition_estimation import FairGroups
from fair_partition.visualization import plot_partition_with_ci

# Create fair groups
fair_groups = FairGroups(nb_groups=5)
fair_groups.fit(s, y)

# Visualize the partition with confidence intervals
plot_partition_with_ci(fair_groups.partition, fair_groups.phi_by_group_ci, 'S')
```

This will create a plot showing:
- The partition boundaries on the x-axis
- The positive outcome rates for each group
- Confidence intervals for the positive outcome rates
